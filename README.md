# Plan B Streaming

This is a Next.js application for streaming live TV channels, built with Firebase integration.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## Firebase Setup

This application is configured to connect to a Firebase project.

1.  **Firebase Configuration**: The Firebase configuration is located in `src/lib/firebase.ts`. The placeholder values from the proposal have been used.

2.  **Firestore Database**: The application expects a Firestore database with two collections: `channels` and `mdc25`.

3.  **Data Structure**: Each document in the `channels` collection should have the following structure:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Channel Name",
      "logoUrl": "https://...",
      "streamUrl": "https://... (embeddable link)",
      "category": "Category Name",
      "description": "A brief channel description."
    }
    ```

4.  **Mundial de Clubes 2025**: The hero section on the homepage fetches matches from the `mdc25` collection. Each document should have the following structure:
    ```json
    {
        "team1": "Team A Name",
        "team1Logo": "https://...",
        "team2": "Team B Name",
        "team2Logo": "https://...",
        "matchTimestamp": "(Timestamp) June 20, 2025 at 4:00:00 PM (Argentinian Time)",
        "channels": ["channel_id_1", "channel_id_2"],
        "matchDetails": "Fase de grupos 路 Grupo E 路 Jornada 2 de 3"
    }
    ```
    - **`matchTimestamp`**: This is the most important field. It must be of type **`timestamp`** in Firestore. It determines when the match is shown. **Important:** When you select the date and time in the Firebase console, it will use your computer's local time zone. The application will correctly display it in Argentinian time (UTC-3). Matches will appear on the homepage **only if their start date is the current day** and will disappear 3 hours after they have started.
    - **`channels`**: This must be an array of **strings**. Each string should be the document ID of a channel from your `channels` collection. The app will automatically fetch the channel name.
    - **`matchDetails`**: This is an optional **`string`** field where you can add extra information about the match, such as the tournament stage (e.g., "Fase de grupos 路 Grupo E 路 Jornada 2 de 3").

    ### How to Add a Match with a Timestamp

    1.  Go to your **`mdc25` Collection** in Firestore.
    2.  Create a new document for your match.
    3.  Add the team and logo fields as usual.
    4.  Click **"Add field"** and enter `matchTimestamp` as the field name.
    5.  For **Type**, select **`timestamp`** from the dropdown menu.
    6.  A date and time picker will appear. Select the exact date and start time for the match.
    7.  Add the `channels` field as an `array` of strings.
    8.  Optionally, add the `matchDetails` field as a `string`.
    9.  Click **"Save"**.

5.  **Security Rules**: For production, ensure your Firestore security rules are properly configured to allow read access to the collections. A basic rule for public read access would be:
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /channels/{channelId} {
          allow read: if true;
          allow write: if false; // Or your admin logic
        }
        match /mdc25/{matchId} {
          allow read: if true;
          allow write: if false; // Or your admin logic
        }
      }
    }
    ```

For demonstration purposes, the application will use placeholder data if it cannot fetch data from Firebase.
